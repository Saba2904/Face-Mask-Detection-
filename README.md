# Face-Mask-Detection-
Project Title: Face Mask Detection System

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a real-time face mask detection system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. 
The system will be able to identify individuals wearing masks and those without, providing a valuable tool for ensuring adherence
to public health guidelines and promoting safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key Features:

1. Real-time face detection and mask classification
2. Utilizing deep learning models for accurate mask detection
3. Capable of handling various image and video formats
4. Potential for integration with security systems and surveillance cameras
Project Goals:

Develop a robust and efficient face mask detection system
Contribute to the implementation of safety measures in public spaces
Enhance the detection of mask-wearing individuals for epidemiological studies
Promote open-source development and collaboration in the field of computer vision

Team Members:
1.Sejal Palde
2.Saba Momin

Project Status:

The project is currently in the development phase, with the initial focus on building a functional face mask detection model. Further enhancements and integrations are planned for future iterations.

Contributions:

We welcome contributions from the community in the form of code improvements, model optimization, and additional features. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
